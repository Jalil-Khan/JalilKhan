Hi there, I'm Jalil Khan ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineering student with a passion for web design, video editing, and website development. I enjoy creating beautiful and functional designs using Figma and turning them into fully functional WordPress websites.

Recently, I've become interested in the field of data science and am currently learning the ropes of this exciting and dynamic field. I'm excited to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world data problems and make a positive impact with my work.

When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me exploring new cafes and restaurants, watching movies, or going for a run. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email - I'd love to chat! jalilkhanfall2@gmail.com
